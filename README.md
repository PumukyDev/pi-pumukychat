# PumukyChat

## Introduction

**PumukyChat** is a secure, real-time messaging platform built with Laravel and React. It focuses on privacy-first communication by implementing end-to-end encryption with RSA and AES, ensuring that only users can read their messages — not even the server.

The app supports group chats, file attachments, dark/light themes, and mobile responsiveness out of the box.
