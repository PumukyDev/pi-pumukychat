# PumukyDev Web Server

This is my **self hosted web server**. At the moment it is hosted in my desktop computer with debian so **do not expect great availability** (In a few months it will be running 24/7 in a Raspberry Pi)

## Features
* Has a simple, but intuitive and usable User Interface.
* URL shortener tool.
* Status page.
* logo.png for some tests.
* Automatic provisioning made with Vagrant.
* /admin and /status password protection.
* Dynamic DNS configuration to autoconfigure my new home ip if it changes.

## Status page with grafana

Check my server status in https://pumukydev.com/status/ . There, you can see many information about my server (time up, loads, conections, etc
)
![showing grafana](assets/images/grafana-example.jpg)

If you want more detailed information [click here](./config/monitoring/README.md)

## URL Shortener in action...

Try my own url shortener system in https://pumukydev.com/shortener/ . If you want short any link, just introduce it and you will get a shorter url for your video or page. There you can see an example:

![showing url-shortener](assets/screencasts/url-shortener.gif)

If you want more detailed information [click here](./htdocs/shortener/README.md)

## Getting started

### Download

You can download the proyect with just one command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PumukyDev/web-server.git
```

### Configuration

After downloading the files you have to open your router ports for the machine's ip (default 192.168.1.202)

![opening ports](assets/images/ports.jpg)

> [!WARNING]
> If your ip do not start with 192.168.1.X or it is in use, change the ip, just change the next line in the [Vagrantfile](Vagrantfile). You may also have to change the bridge connector (you can check it making a `ip a` in the terminal). If you have changed the ip, change it from the [hosts](./ansible/hosts) file too 


```ruby
s.vm.network "public_network", ip: "192.168.1.202", bridge: "enp4s0"
```

```
[server]
192.168.1.202 
ansible_ssh_user=vagrant
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa
ansible_port=2222
```


> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you don't have any ssh key, generate a new pair with `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`

Create a new .env file with your ionos api key, it is used to manage txt records [URL-shortener](./htdocs/shortener/README.md) and to configure the [Dynamic DNS](./config/dynamic-dns/README.md). Change "pumukydev" domain with your own domain

If you want to use HTTPS in you server, create a certs folder inside `config/apache2/` and paste your own ionos certification keys.


### Starting the server

To start the server, just make:

```bash
make up
```

To destroy the vm, try:

```bash
make clean
```

If you don't know if you have ansible or vagrant, try:

```bash
make validate
```

    <summary style="font-size: 20px"><b>Performance tests</b></summary><br/>

These tests are made with `ab`, which is a tool for benchmarking your Apache Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server. It is designed to give you an impression of how  your  current  Apache installation  performs. This especially shows you how many requests per second your Apache installation is capable of serving.


<details>
    <summary style="font-size: 17.5px"><b>Normal tests</b></summary><br/>

### Parameters:

* `-k` : Enable the HTTP KeepAlive  feature,  i.e.,  perform  multiple  requests within one HTTP session. Default is no KeepAlive.

* `-c` (concurrency): Number of multiple requests to perform at a time Default is one request at a time.

* `-n` (requests): Number of requests to perform for the benchmarking session. The default is to just perform a single request which usually leads  to  non-repre‚Äê sentative benchmarking results.



### 100 users and 1000 requests


<details>
    <summary><b>Index page with SSL3 and TLS1.2</b></summary><br/>

Extra Parameters:

* `-f` (protocol): Specify SSL/TLS protocol (SSL2, TLS1, TLS1.1, TLS1.2, TLS1.3 or ALL)


```bash
ab -k -f SSL3 -c 100 -n 1000 https://pumukydev.com/
```

![performance image](assets/images/performance/100-1000-f-SSL3.jpg)

> [!NOTE]
> SSL3 is deprecated so apache use TLS1.3 automatically, so this test is made with TLS1.3 instead of SSL3 actually.

The test duration was **1.556 seconds**, during which all **1000 requests** were successfully completed with no failures. Out of those, **994 requests** reused connections, reducing overhead thanks to HTTP Keep-Alive.

On average, the server handled **642.57 requests per second**, with each individual request taking about **155.6 ms** to process. Considering all concurrent requests, the average request time dropped to **1.556 ms**. The server achieved a **transfer rate of 873.95 KB/s**, transferring a total of **1,392,731 bytes**, where **1,165,000 bytes** corresponded to the actual HTML content.

Connection times were broken down into phases:

* **Connection** was almost instantaneous, with a median of **0 ms**.  
* **Processing** the requests took **7 ms** on average.  
* **Waiting** time, the delay before receiving the first byte of the response, was also about **7 ms**.  

The final breakdown shows that **90% of the requests** were completed within **12 ms**, and **95% within 16 ms**. The **longest request** took **1369 ms** to complete.


```bash
ab -k -f TLS1.2 -c 100 -n 1000 https://pumukydev.com/
```

![performance image](assets/images/performance/100-1000-f-TLS1.2.jpg)

The test duration was **0.366 seconds**, during which **1,000 requests** were completed with **0 failures**. All **1,000 requests** reused connections, reducing overhead thanks to HTTP Keep-Alive.

On average, the server handled **2,732.69 requests per second**, with each individual request taking about **36.594 ms** to process. Considering all concurrent requests, the average request time dropped to **0.366 ms**.

Connection times were broken down into phases:

* **Connection** was very fast, with a median of **0 ms**.  
* **Processing** the requests took **7 ms** on average.  
* **Waiting** time, the delay before receiving the first byte of the response, was about **7 ms**.  

The final breakdown shows that **90% of the requests** were completed within **8 ms**, and **95% within 66 ms**. The **longest request** took **107 ms** to complete.

The test duration was **5.838 seconds**, during which **10,000 requests** were completed with **0 failures**. Out of those, **9,990 requests** reused connections, reducing overhead thanks to HTTP Keep-Alive.

On average, the server handled **1,712.94 requests per second**, with each individual request taking about **583.793 ms** to process. Considering all concurrent requests, the average request time dropped to **0.584 ms**. The server achieved a **transfer rate of 1,213.78 KB/s**, transferring a total of **7,256,015 bytes**, where **4,750,000 bytes** corresponded to the actual HTML content.

Connection times were broken down into phases:

* **Connection** was nearly instantaneous, with a median of **0 ms**.  
* **Processing** the requests took **8 ms** on average.  
* **Waiting** time, the delay before receiving the first byte of the response, was about **8 ms**.  

The final breakdown shows that **90% of the requests** were completed within **9 ms**, and **95% within 9 ms**. The **longest request** took **5,803 ms** to complete.

    <summary style="font-size: 17.5px"><b>Conclusion</b></summary><br/>

Overall, the server has demonstrated excellent performance during the tests, completing all requests with consistent response times and no failures, except in specific scenarios. 

The system successfully handled the majority of tests under different levels of load, maintaining high efficiency in data transfer and effectively utilizing Keep-Alive connections to reduce overhead. Additionally, the server performed exceptionally well when tested with the `-H` parameter for compression, showing its capability to optimize resource delivery under compressed headers.

However, specific issues were identified in the image tests, particularly those involving **10,000 simultaneous requests**, where higher response times and a significant number of failures were observed. This behavior might indicate bottlenecks in handling static content or limitations in the server's configuration to handle high concurrency in these specific cases.
